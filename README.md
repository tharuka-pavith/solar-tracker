# solar-tracker
This project uses an array of LDRs to track sunlight. The LDR readings are processed to determine the optimal angle for the solar panel. A servo motor is used to adjust the solar panel's orientation. This solar tracker is designed to enhance energy efficiency, making it an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution for renewable energy generation.
